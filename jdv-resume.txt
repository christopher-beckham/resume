EXPERIENCE

Throughout my career, I've demonstrated the consistent ability to take the lead on large projects and deliver results. Most recently I managed the development of a sophisticated set of tools for handling and analyzing biomedical data, and a set of machine learning tools to predict the best course of treatment for patients, positioning my research team at the forefront of what's possible in our field.

Research Methods Specialist
2014--present
Kimel TIGRlab, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health

+ Managed the design & implementation (team of 5) of a sophisticated data management platform used daily by researchers (team of 20).
+ Invented an accurate machine learning test that identifies vulnerable patients, & directed 2 other similar successful projects, including 1 deep learning project.
+ Managed R&D (team of 3) of quality assurance tools that repair corrupted data & detect critical hardware failures.
+ Led R&D on multiple novel analytic approaches that have guided the majority of the lab's research during my tenure.
+ Lead developer of production analysis code used by our scientists.
+ Mentored scientists, post docs, graduate students, & engineers.
+ Managed a 22-node compute cluster.
+ Designed & contributed key analysis, writing, & tools for 2 successfully funded grants & 7 published papers.
